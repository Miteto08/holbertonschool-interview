## Overview
Welcome to Slide-Line, a replication of the classic 2048 game! This Readme provides an introduction to Slide-Line, its objective, and basic instructions on how to play.

### What is Slide-Line?
Slide-Line is a puzzle game inspired by the popular 2048 game. The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them, ultimately reaching the elusive tile with the number 2048.

### Objective
The primary goal of Slide-Line is to achieve the highest possible score by strategically combining tiles. The game is won when a tile with the number 2048 is created, but the challenge continues to see how high of a score you can attain.

#### How to Play
Tile Movement:

#### Tiles on the grid can be moved in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
Tile Combination:

#### When two tiles with the same number collide during a move, they merge into a single tile with a value equal to the sum of the two tiles.
Scoring:

#### Points are earned with each successful tile combination. The score increases as higher-numbered tiles are created.
Game Over:

#### The game is over when there are no valid moves left, and the grid is filled.

### Tips for Success

#### Plan Ahead:

#### Anticipate the consequences of each move to strategically position tiles for optimal combinations.
Combine Wisely:

#### Focus on combining higher-numbered tiles to maximize your score and work towards the 2048 tile.
Empty Spaces:

Keep spaces on the grid open for maneuvering tiles and creating larger combinations.
