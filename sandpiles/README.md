# Sandpile Simulation

## Overview
Welcome to the Sandpile Simulation! This project explores the fascinating concept of sandpile models, a type of cellular automaton used to study complex systems and self-organized criticality. This Readme provides an overview of the simulation, its purpose, and basic usage guidelines.

### What is a Sandpile Model?
A sandpile model is a mathematical and computational model that represents a system where grains of sand are dropped onto a grid. The grains accumulate, and when a certain threshold is reached, instability occurs, causing an "avalanche." These avalanches exhibit self-organized criticality, a property found in systems that naturally evolve to a critical state.

### Purpose of the Simulation
The primary purpose of this simulation is to visualize and study the emergent behavior of sandpile models. By iteratively dropping sand grains and observing the resulting avalanches, users can gain insights into the dynamics of self-organized critical systems.

### How to Use
Explore the Initial Configuration:

### The simulation starts with an initial configuration of sand grains on the grid.
Drop Sand Grains:

### Interactively drop sand grains onto the grid and observe how the system responds.
Avalanches:

### When a cell exceeds a certain threshold (often 3), an avalanche occurs, redistributing sand to neighboring cells.
Visualization:

The simulation provides visual feedback on the state of the sandpile, highlighting cells that are unstable or part of an ongoing avalanche.
